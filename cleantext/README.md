# Triform.ai Template: Text Cleaner

## Overview
This Python template is designed for cleaning text data by removing hyphenated line-breaks, newlines, and form feed characters. It's ideal for preprocessing textual data for further analysis or processing within AI workflows on the Triform platform.

## How it Works
The module receives text input through an event object. It checks for the presence of text, cleans it by removing specific unwanted characters, and returns the cleaned text in JSON format.

## Use Cases
- Preprocessing text for NLP tasks.
- Cleaning data extracted from PDFs or other documents that may contain formatting characters.
- Standardizing text input for data analytics or machine learning models.

## Customization
Users can modify this script to handle other types of textual noise or formatting issues, adapt it to handle different input formats, or integrate it with other data cleaning pipelines.
